# House Price Prediction model

### This model is trained on California house data available on Kaggle and in this repository.

### After performing necessary EDA steps like dropping the entries with null values, we got an idea about the relationship of the features through the correlation matrix obtained using seaborn.

### Random forest and linear regression algorithms are used for regression purposes and the model obtained has the train accuracy of about 97% and test accuracy of about 83%.

### Necessary libraries are listed first, and then the whole machine learning algorithm is applied.
